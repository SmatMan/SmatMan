# Hey! I'm SmatMan, A.K.A. Bren!

#### If you're here for info about a5y17lte device trees, I'm not the person to ask. I don't maintain mine anymore, and they currently serve as a reference rather than a usable copy.

Anyway, hey! I'm bren/SmatMan. I'm fluent in Python, and I'm proficient in React and React Native. I have a few cool projects you might like to check out, including Scrobbli and dashing.
